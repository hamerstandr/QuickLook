## Background
One of the few features I missed from macOS is [Quick Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look). It allows users to peek into a file content in lightning speed by just pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key. Windows, on the other hand, does not have this handy feature ... until now.

I am aware that several alternatives are already available on the Internet (e.g. [WinQuickLook](https://github.com/shibayan/WinQuickLook) and [Seer](https://github.com/ccseer/Seer)). Despite these options, I still decided to craft another one by myself, because they are either not being actively developed, lack of variety, or ask for some :dollar:.

## Highlights

 - Tons of supported file types (full list [here](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Supported-File-Types))
 - Fluent design (new in version 0.3)
 - Touchscreen friendly
 - HiDPI support
 - Preview from *Open* and *Save File* Dialog
 - Preview from 3rd-party file managers (see a list [here](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/File-Managers))
 - Easily extended by [plugins](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Available-Plugins)
 - Strict GPL license to keep it free forever

## Usage

### Download/Installation

Get it from one of the following sources:

  * Microsoft Store (Windows 10 users only, no preview in open/save-dialogs available) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nv4bs3l1h4s?ocid=badge" target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.windowsphone.com/13484911-a6ab-4170-8b7e-795c1e8b4165/English_get_L_InvariantCulture_Default.png" height="22px" alt="Store Link" /></a> 
  * Installer or portable archive of the stable version from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/releases) 
  * Nightly builds from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/xupefei/quicklook/build/artifacts)

[What are the differences between `.msi`, `.zip`, Nightly and Store versions?](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Differences-Between-Distributions)

**Note:** Don't forget to check out the [plugins](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Available-Plugins) for previewing office-files, epubs, fonts and more!


### Typical usecase

1. Run `QuickLook.exe` (only necessary if autostart is disabled)
1. Select any file or folder (on the Desktop, in a File Explorer window, in an *Open* or *Save-File* dialogue, doesn't matter)
1. Press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>
1. Enjoy the preview and interact with it
1. Preview next file by clicking on it or using arrow-keys (arrow-keys move selection in the background if the preview window is not in focus)
1. When you're done close it by either hitting <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> again, pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> or clicking the `‚®â` button
